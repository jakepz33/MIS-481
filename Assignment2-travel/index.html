            <p> Lake Tahoe, the clear, cobalt blue lake tucked into the snowy Sierra Nevada mountain range, welcomes athletes, adventurers and casual travelers to its easygoing and pine-scented atmosphere. A long sought-after vacation destination, Lake Tahoe keeps everyone’s interests piqued and their vacations active throughout the year. Lake Tahoe is the nation’s second deepest lake, and the area previously served as a transcontinental route for first the railroad and later highways</p>
